## About :point_down: 

<div align="justified">

## Purpose :point_down:

<div align="justified">
  
 A car rental is a system that can be used temporarily for a fee during a specified period. Getting a rental car helps people get around despite the fact they do not have access to their own personal vehicle or don’t own a vehicle at all. The individual who needs a car must contact a rental car company and contact out for a vehicle. This system increases customer retention and simplify vehicle and staff management. 
Aims and Objectives:
•	To produce a Java based database connected (JDBC) software system that allow customer data entry and reserve a particular model of car for a specified period of time and effectively manage their car rental system
•	To ease handling customers rented record.
Benefits it need to provide:
	The database relational model should be clear enough and easily understood and flexible to use.
	The software must help in back office administration by streamlining and standardising the procedures.
	The hourly time slots allocation must be provided.
	Customer’s authenticity must be kept in mind.
	Data when required for any particular customer when searched should immediately pop up.
	The relational schema of the database connected with the project must be easy enough to understand.
	Repetition of data records must not be entertained.
	Record handling should be easy.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
Requirement analysis is a software engineering technique that is composed of the various tasks that determine the needs or conditions that are to be met for a new or altered product, taking into consideration the possible conflicting requirements of the various users.
Functional requirements are those requirements that are used to illustrate the internal working nature of the system, the description of the system, and explanation of each subsystem. It consists of what task the system should perform the process involved, which data should the system holds and the interfaces with the user. The functional requirement identified are:
a.	Adding Customers:
All the required customers detail along with specified duration of car hours proposed for rentals along with car model and unique car number.
b.	Displaying Whole Record:
All the added records are stored in a database and being displayed whenever the function is being called along with the time and date of issue.
c.	Searching Particular Customer Information:
By entering a particular model number of the car rented all the information of the particular customer is being displayed. If no such record is found the particular message displaying no such model rented is displayed.
d.	Deleting Records:
Once a customer has successfully returned the rented car the record could be easily deleted and the successive change in the database is being automatically handled.
e.	Updating Phone Number:
A request for changing customer’s phone number could be easily handled by entering the unique id of the customer and entering the new phone number which then gets updated in the database.
f.	Automatic update:
 to database once reservation is made or new customer registered, the system updates the database without any additional efforts of the admin.

JDBC Connectivity:
We have successfully established a connection with the relation database model and created a new database called “garage_records” using mysql .With the specified root route and in the specified location (here localhost ) with particular username and password we have established a smooth connection with our java project. Handling records and searching for them becomes easier which such database management system.
 We used a table “car_rent” in our database and created and array “carnos[]” in order to check if multiple records of same model of car is being entered the entry is being declined stating that the above model is being already in rent. 
Such error handling easy searching and safer security of storing data is only being established with the help of this JDBC connectivity.
